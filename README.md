# Altor-Pizza-End to End Project

Business requirements analysis, schema designing, database troubleshooting, sql query, data cleaning, data analysis, data modeling, data visualization using looker studio. 

Client Altor is opening a pizzeria.It is takeout delivery a bit like dominos. The project is to design and build a relational database for his business that allow him to capture and store all the important information and data that the business generates. These will in turn help Altor to monitor business performance through the dashboard that will also be built later. He has a summary of data  that he wanted in the database.  This includes the recipes.

 
### Owners Questions that needed to be answered.
1.	What are the total orders per category?
2.	Delivery percentage as per my rider’s performance?

### Main areas of focus

A. Customers Orders
- To design the database and table in it, we will spec out all the fields of the data we want to collect. Then normalize the data adding more related tables and defining the table relationship. He has specified the different data he wants to collect from each order.

Orders Data Required
•	Item name
•	Item price
•	Quantity
•	Customer name
•	Delivery address
•	Product Category
•	Pizza 
•	Sides 
•	Desserts 
•	Beverages

B.	Stock Control Requirement 
- Wants to be able to know when its times to order new stock. 
-To do this were going to need more information about the following what ingredients go into each pizza ,their quantity based on the size of the pizza ,the existing stock levels
- Different lead times of suppliers to calculate exactly when to order each item or ingredients. The owner said lead time for delivery by suppliers is the same for all ingredients.

C. Staff data requirements
  - Wants to know which staff member are working when.
  - Based on the staff salary information, how much each pizza costs( ingredients+chefs+delivery)

### Designing Phase

-	There are various ways to do this. Due to lack of resources, budget and  connection issues, I will be doing it with this method to save money. 
-	Everything that can be done in MySQL can also be done in Access but I prefer doing it in MySQL because it is more friendly user.
-	There are various kinds of visualization that can also be use. But the friendliest I have used so far is Google Looker Studio. Due to connection issues as well, I have manually imported those visualization datasets in my google drive after changing the type into Google Sheets.
